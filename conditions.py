# Create a Python program that:


# - Prompts a user to enter their age.
# - Uses a conditional statement to check if the age is greater than or equal to 18.
# - Prints "You are eligible to vote" if true, otherwise "You are not eligible to vote."

    This function prompts the user to input their age and then checks if they are eligible to vote.

        The function uses colorama for colorful terminal output.
